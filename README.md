### üõ†Ô∏è Analytical Approach
1. **Data Processing** (Python):
   - Cleaned missing values and standardized manufacturer names
   - Calculated range statistics by model year
   - Categorized CAFV eligibility status

2. **Analysis Dimensions**:
   - Geographic distribution by county
   - Market share by manufacturer
   - Technology trends (range improvement)
   - Policy impact analysis

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar/line/pie charts using Matplotlib/Seaborn
   - Generated geographic heatmaps
